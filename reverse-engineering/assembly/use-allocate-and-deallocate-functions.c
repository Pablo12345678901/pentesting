     The first one is too big to be allocated to what was 'freed' by the 'deallocate' function.
     The second one is enough little to fit within the space left by 'a1'.
     But the third not, because :
     - 'a1' was big of : 500 bytes + header (16 bytes) = 516 bytes
     - 'a4' is 1000 bytes + header (16 bytes) so it is bigger than 516 bytes (a1).
     - 'a5' is 250 bytes + header (16 bytes) so it is 266 bytes -> 'a5' fits within the space left by 'a1'.
     - But then, only 516 - 266 = 250 bytes are left. Not enough for the 266 bytes of 'a6'.
